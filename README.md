**Description**

This is a personal portfolio webpage developed using HTML and CSS as part of an academic/web development task. It 

serves as a digital showcase of my work, skills, and background as a frontend web developer. The main aim of this 

project is to design a clean, responsive, and well-structured portfolio site that introduces me and highlights my 

key projects and strengths.

**About**

This project is a static portfolio website created entirely with HTML and CSS. It has no backend functionality and 

does not use any JavaScript or frameworks. The purpose was to build a visually appealing webpage that gives a clear

overview of who I am, what I’ve worked on, and how to connect with me.

The portfolio includes a navigation bar, an about section, a skills section, a project showcase, and a contact area.

All sections are organized with semantic HTML tags and styled using custom CSS to ensure clarity, consistency, and

responsiveness on different screen sizes.

This project helped reinforce my understanding of:

- Semantic HTML structure

- Layout techniques using CSS Flexbox and Grid

- Responsive web design using media queries

- Basic design principles like alignment, spacing, and color schemes

**Features**

- Fully static and lightweight

- Smooth scrolling navigation

- Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)

- About Me section to introduce myself

- Skills list showing technologies I know

- Projects section with descriptions

- Contact section with email or social media links

- Clean and minimalist UI

**Tools & Technologies Used**

*HTML5 – for markup and semantic structure

*CSS3 – for styling, layout, and responsiveness

*Font Awesome Icons – for social media icons

**Responsiveness**

The webpage is responsive and adjusts its layout for different screen sizes. I used CSS media queries to ensure the 

site works well on smartphones, tablets, and desktops.

**IDE USED**

I have used Visual Studio Code (VS code) to develop this portfolio.

**Description**

This is a personal portfolio webpage developed using HTML and CSS as part of an academic/web development task. It 

serves as a digital showcase of my work, skills, and background as a frontend web developer. The main aim of this 

project is to design a clean, responsive, and well-structured portfolio site that introduces me and highlights my 

key projects and strengths.

**About**

This project is a static portfolio website created entirely with HTML and CSS. It has no backend functionality and 

does not use any JavaScript or frameworks. The purpose was to build a visually appealing webpage that gives a clear

overview of who I am, what I’ve worked on, and how to connect with me.

The portfolio includes a navigation bar, an about section, a skills section, a project showcase, and a contact area.

All sections are organized with semantic HTML tags and styled using custom CSS to ensure clarity, consistency, and

responsiveness on different screen sizes.

This project helped reinforce my understanding of:

- Semantic HTML structure

- Layout techniques using CSS Flexbox and Grid

- Responsive web design using media queries

- Basic design principles like alignment, spacing, and color schemes

**Features**

- Fully static and lightweight

- Smooth scrolling navigation

- Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)

- About Me section to introduce myself

- Skills list showing technologies I know

- Projects section with descriptions

- Contact section with email or social media links

- Clean and minimalist UI

**Tools & Technologies Used**

*HTML5 – for markup and semantic structure

*CSS3 – for styling, layout, and responsiveness

*Font Awesome Icons – for social media icons

**Responsiveness**

The webpage is responsive and adjusts its layout for different screen sizes. I used CSS media queries to ensure the 

site works well on smartphones, tablets, and desktops.

**Uses:**

Creating a portfolio website is not just about showcasing work—it's a valuable tool with many practical benefits. Here are the main uses of this project:

* 1. Showcase Your Skills and Projects
This portfolio allows you to present your web development skills, technologies you’ve worked with, and the projects you’ve built. It serves as a visual resume 

that highlights what you can do.

* 2. Impress Recruiters and Hiring Managers

A well-designed portfolio makes a strong first impression. It helps potential employers or internship providers quickly understand your capabilities and 

creativity without needing to ask for your resume or GitHub profile.

* 3. Create a Professional Online Presence

Your portfolio acts as your personal brand on the web. It builds credibility and allows people to find you through search engines, increasing your visibility in

the tech community.

* 4. Demonstrate Frontend Development Skills

Building a portfolio website using HTML and CSS shows your ability to structure content semantically, apply styling effectively, and create responsive designs.

* 5. Useful During Interviews

Interviewers often ask for examples of your work. You can directly share your portfolio link to demonstrate your design sense, code organization, and the 

variety of projects you’ve worked on.

* 6. Practice Real-World Web Development

This project helps you understand:

- Page layout and structure using HTML

- Styling and responsiveness using CSS
